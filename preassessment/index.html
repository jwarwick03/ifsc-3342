    <h2>My Assessment</h2>
    <p>The most important goal of effective communication is clarity. Clarity is not the same as simplicity . Often, simple things are clear if the message is intended to be brief and small, but often the message is about a complex relationship that can only be presented with a necessarily large amount of data. </p>
    <p class="alert">This complexity can be made to appear clear by effective organization and presentation and need not be reduced to meaningless "bite-sized" chunks of data, as simplification usually does. </p>
    <p><img src="assets/img/content-image2.jpg" alt="The most interesting person in the world" class="img-right" />Clarity refers to the focus on one particular message or goal at a time, rather than attempting to accomplish too much at once. Simplicity is often responsible for the "dumbing" of information rather than the illumination of it.</p>
    <h3>Questions</h3>
    <p>Please answer the following questions below. Remember to markup the information properly using HTML</p>
    <h4>Explain the difference between the &quot;alt&quot; attribute and the &quot;title&quot; attribute. </h4>
    <p>The alt attribute is only used on image tags and is text that shows up incase the image doesn't load and it helps the screen reader.
      The title attribute is mostly used for link tags so that a description of the link can pop up when hovered over.</p>
    <h4>Please provide an example below of how to mark up a definition from the dictionary</h4>
    <dl class="d-list">
      <dt>Patience</dt>
      <dd>The capacity to accept or tolerate delay, trouble, or suffering without getting angry or upset.</dd>
      <dt>Joy</dt>
      <dd>A feeling of great pleasure and happiness.</dd>
    </dl>
