    <h2>Find the Best Workout Split for You</h2>
    <p>
      A workout routine split is a training program that divides the week into 
      separate workouts, each targeting different muscle groups. This allows 
      you to focus on specific areas of the body on different days, ensuring that 
      each muscle group gets enough attention and recovery time.
      <br>
      <br>
      If the Push Pull Legs split is not for you, there are many other effective 
      training splits. The most effective splits are those that support your goals 
      and YOU follow through with.
