          <h3>What is the Push, Pull, Legs workout split?</h3>
          <p>The push pull legs (or PPL for short) split is one of the most popular workout programs for building muscle and strength gains. 
            Many athletes and bodybuilders, including advanced lifters, swear by the PPL routine as the best way to train for muscle mass. 
            Not only is it effective for muscle growth, but you can tailor it to your schedule to reach your fitness goals, whatever they 
            might be.
